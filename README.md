This project estimates the Value-at-Risk (VaR) of a portfolio built from academic and trading alternative risk premia (ARP) using a minimum variance optimization approach. The portfolio is constructed without relying on return assumptions, instead minimizing overall volatility based on historical correlations and variances. From an initial set of seven equity strategies, four were selected—Value, Quality, Momentum, and Short Volatility—to form a long/short portfolio weighted using minimum variance. Beta neutrality is maintained via hedging against the Eurostoxx 50, and a 3x leverage constraint is applied.

The monthly VaR is computed at a 99% confidence level, resulting in a portfolio-level VaR of -1.72%. Among individual factors, Quality exhibits the highest risk at -2.88%, while Momentum is the lowest at -0.69%. These values reflect the maximum expected loss within one month under normal market conditions, though VaR does not account for losses beyond the confidence threshold.

To validate and enhance the analysis, a non-parametric Monte Carlo bootstrap simulation (1,000 runs) was performed without assuming return distributions. The average simulated VaR was -1.55%, consistent with the earlier result, and diagnostics confirmed the quality of the simulation. Finally, a time-varying VaR was estimated using an ARMA-GARCH model, which captured volatility clustering over time and produced a more conservative average VaR of -4.34%, with a 95% confidence interval ranging from -6.71% to -2.67%.

Overall, this multi-method framework offers a robust and dynamic approach to measuring portfolio risk, balancing exposure to alternative premia while ensuring controlled downside risk—especially relevant for institutional and risk-conscious investors.
